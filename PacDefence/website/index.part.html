  <p>
    Pac Defence is a tower defence game.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aim of the game is to destroy the evil pacs before they can reach their goal, the goal we
    all share, to go off the side of the screen. In order to stop them you can choose from 17 towers
    to build, or enlist the pac's greatest foe, the ghost. However, towers cost money, so you cannot
    build as many as you want, and thus you must carefully choose which tower you want to build and
    where you want to build it. You gain money by damaging and destroying the pacs, and for
    finishing each level. Additionally, towers gain level ups after inflicting certain amounts of
    pain on the pacs. <br />
    So, what are you waiting for, get playing!
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The game is written in Java, therefore you need a Java runtime environment installed to play,
  which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.java.com">here</a>.
  (Most people already have one of these installed).
  You can either play this game as an
  <a href="pacdefence.html">applet</a>
  or can download and play it outside of your browser.
