<h2>Pac Defence</h2>

<br>

<p>
Pac Defence is a tower defence game. <br>
The aim of the game is to destroy the evil pacs before they can reach their goal, the goal we all
share, to go off the side of the screen. In order to stop them you can choose from 17 towers to
build, or enlist the pac's greatest foe, the ghost. However, towers cost money, so you cannot build
as many as you want, and thus you must carefully choose which tower you want to build and where you
want to build it. You gain money by damaging and destroying the pacs, and at the end of each level.
Additionally, towers gain level ups after inflicting certain amounts of pain on the pacs.
<br>
So, what are you waiting for, get playing!
</p>

<p>
The game is written in Java, therefore you need a Java runtime environment installed to play. (Don't
worry, most people already do). You can either play this game as an
<a href="pacdefence.html">applet</a> or can download and play it outside of your browser.
<br>
If you get redirected to the Java web site when trying to play it through the web site, you either
don't have Java installed, or don't have a new enough version of Java, at least Java 6 is needed.
You can download this from the site it redirects you to.
