<title>Pac Defence - Development</title>

</head>

<body>

<p>
At the moment it'd be fairly hard for someone else to be involved in the development, but if there's
anyone interested I'd seriously consider hosting this on sourceforge or google code or the like (I
don't really know the pros and cons of the different sites). At the moment I use a subversion
repository on my own computer, for the various benefits it gives.

<h4>Things to do</h4>

<ul>
   <li>Make a better default skin. I'm really bad at art, as you can probably see from the current
   skin, so it'd be awesome if someone else could do this. (Though I'll try and make the current one
   look better)</li>
   <li>I'm actually kind of out of any big ideas to change the game, but am welcome to suggestions.
   I can be contacted by the email address shown in the opening screen. When I do come up with ideas
   I generally try and implement them quickly, as the rest of my life permits.</li>
</ul>
