Pac Defence v1.1.5

For help in playing the game, check out the manual, which is available on the
web site, www.freewebs.com/pacdefence, or if you have the version of the jar
that includes the source, it should be in there.


You need a Java virtual machine installed to run this game, version 6 or greater.

The command to run the game (should) be:

java -jar PacDefence.jar


At the time of writing this, the command line switches that the game recognises
are:

--debugTimes   Display the times of different parts of the internals. Used for
               evaluating performance.
--debugPath    Draws some information about the path (that the sprites follow).
               This is primarily used when making a new map.
--debugAll     Turns on both of the above.
               


If you find the game runs too slow at higher levels (particularly if you run
with the --debugTimes command line switch and see the bullet time running
high), try running the game with the server vm. In my (very) brief test, it was
about twice as fast on level 30 and with ~4000 bullets with the server vm than
the default client vm. Note that this will increase startup time. YMMV.
